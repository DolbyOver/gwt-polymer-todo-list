# Build a modern GWT app using Polymer elements: 

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll write a **Todo List** application using web components. 

Our application will fulfill the Material Design specification, so we will use Polymer Iron and Paper components using Vaadin gwt-polymer-elements library.

Gwt-Polymer-Elements is a `JsInterop` wrapper for Iron and Paper elements which has been produced using Vaadin gwt-api-generator.

Try the [Todo List](http://manolo.github.io/gwt-polymer-todo/todo.html) application to check how your application should look like when you finish the tutorial.

In the process of building the **Todo List** app, you'll learn:

* To create a new maven project.
* Running our project in SuperDevMode
* How to add external libraries.
* To Configure the project to use experimental `JsInterop` mode.
* Create new widgets using `UiBinder`
* Import and use Polymer elements
* How to can deal with responsive layouts
* Style elements in `UiBinder`
* Add events handlers to UiBinder components 
* How to use a Basic Data Model.
