# Build a modern GWT app using Polymer elements:

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll write a **TodoList** application using web components.

Web Components are a collection of standards which allow us to bundle markup and styles into custom HTML elements.

In our case we want to fulfill the [Material Design](http://www.google.es/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) specification, thus we will use Polymer [Iron and Paper](https://elements.polymer-project.org/) collections through the Vaadin [gwt-polymer-elements](https://github.com/vaadin/gwt-polymer-elements) library.

Gwt-Polymer-Elements is a `JsInterop` wrapper for Iron and Paper elements which has been produced using the Vaadin [gwt-api-generator](https://github.com/vaadin/gwt-api-generator).

Before starting the tutorial try the [TodoList](http://manolo.github.io/gwt-polymer-todo/todo.html) application to check how your application should look when you finish.

## The Learning process

In the process of building the **TodoList** app, you'll learn:

* To create a new maven project.
* Running our project in SuperDevMode
* How to add external libraries.
* To Configure the project to use experimental `JsInterop` mode.
* Create new widgets using `UiBinder`
* Import and use Polymer elements
* How to can deal with responsive layouts
* Style elements in `UiBinder`
* Add events handlers to UiBinder components
* How to use a Basic Data Model.
